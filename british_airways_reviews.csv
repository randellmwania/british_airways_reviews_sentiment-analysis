0,"""never fly with them again""","i recently travelled from munich to london with british airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. despite checking in successfully, i was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. after seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. after being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. by this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. when i followed up with a complaint, british airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! this experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. british airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. if their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. i will never fly with them again, and i urge others to consider alternative airlines.",2024-11-03,November,2024,1.0
1,"""still have not heard any updates""","i paid for seats 80 a and b on my flight from heathrow to boston on the a380, paying for premium economy seats. upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said i was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old i presume (65) since there is no other reason i can find i could not sit in the exit seating. i am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. we were told our money would be refunded immediately for the ""inconvenience"". after several weeks i recontacted ba and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. the plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. they completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. the captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. we were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. we landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight.",2024-11-03,November,2024,3.0
2,"""cabin crew were nice""","the flight wasn’t that bad, although the inflight entertainment wasn’t great, the screen was very old-fashioned. it was hard to operate in the dark as the touch screen wasn’t working at times. there was though a remote. the cabin crew slamming air larders (ovens and draws). apart from that, the cabin crew were nice, the food was good and the seat was comfortable.",2024-11-03,November,2024,7.0
3,"""support staff wash their hands of you""","i decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to world traveller plus on the return leg of our canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. i hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because i had assumed i would be enjoying the entertainment ba had promised. so i decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. the flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when i had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (i have a bad lower back). early on in this experience i asked to be moved to economy so that i could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. the apologetic flight attendant assured me i would receive compensation, which i assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew ba, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of world traveller plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). ba's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of avios points each. i wrote back (since ba doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds i'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. they then ghosted me. my experience is a cautionary tale about british airways customer support. if all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant world traveller plus experience. but if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. so unless you're prepared to gamble, i would advise you to either stick with economy/world traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from a to b, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. if your flight is to canada, i would recommend an airline such as air canada, which i turned to during the uncertainty of the covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. they do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-covid, i started flying ba again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. i now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds.",2024-11-02,November,2024,1.0

5,"""Who can trust BA to travel2","the flight scheduled at 1840 left 2hours 40 minutes alter due to late arrival of incoming aircraft from naples, as a result i missed a connection from istanbul to dubai, nothing unusual. the issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from rome with rolling effect until the evening. as this was the case, whey did ba not contact me and all other passengers, i could have made other arrangements and fly early to istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a £300 charge and a long delay. ba has certainly lots of staff who could have informed by using the email or text. obviously passengers are of no utility to ba once the ticket is purchased. who can trust ba to travel? not me now after such poor handling of a simple matter.",2024-10-31,October,2024,1.0

7,"""spent two hours trying to make contact with BA""","on arriving at mexico airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from lhr was about six hours late. when we eventually managed to check in we told that – contrary to the ba website – we could not have access to the 24-hour grand lounge elite and instead would use the american airlines admirals club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. after that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to cancun because of a “volcanic ash cloud over mexico city” – although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from europe. they eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. we were assured that we would all be on a ba flight leaving the same time the following day. the only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. he said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (when we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) during the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an air canada flight leaving at 6.30am. this would have been impossible with such short notice and without canadian epa authorisation. we then spent two hours trying to make contact with ba – its mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an aeromexico flight in economy. they told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra £200 for the seats. later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. ba then informed us that because we had already checked in – as they had suggested – we could not be moved and this took three more calls to aeromexico to sort out. i totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. we were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the uk but others – such as a disabled lady – had been told nothing when we left.",2024-10-25,October,2024,1.0
8,"""using another airline for future travel""","i have flown british airways for many years and still do so regularly. in one of my last flights this past summer between paris and boston, british booked me on a connecting flight between paris and london that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in london. london heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. so already, one is pressed for time. my flight from paris to london that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. ba flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one. flight connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that i was rushing to the gate. it was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. i ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. the agent said that since no one knew where i was (false) the plane left without me – early. gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. so i made the 20 minute trek back to flight connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. i was now going to miss the wedding i was destined to attend in boston. they sent me to a prepaid hilton hotel room for the night but told me that i would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. they gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. this was in early july. it took me 4 months and a complaint to the british centre for effective dispute resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. there was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight i won’t ever take with british. like a bad insurance claim, british just kept denying my claim, expecting that i would just go away. well, i am going away. i’m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.",2024-10-24,October,2024,1.0

11,“BA’s petty penny pinching ”,"british airways charge you for the pleasure of choosing your seat and i had been put at the very back of club which turned out to be an advantage because it meant i could get to the seat without having to climb over anybody. the seat was clean but as i later discovered that the foldout section would not stay up and your feet dangled over the edge when the bed was extended. after boarding was complete we were told that departure was delayed because ba had not loaded all of the cargo; we were then told that it was delayed further because there was a fault with one of the fuel pumps. it took over five hours for this problem to be corrected as the pilot later informed us that they installed new pump having initially thought that it was a software issue. during that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which was curious given that we had already been served a pre-departure drink. most of the cabin crew were male and, apparently, based in mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those i spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what was happening. i knew that it was the old-style seats but what was less acceptable is ba’s petty penny pinching. if there was a competition for the smallest hot towel ba would be the winner. the food sounded nice and looked impressive but seemed totally tasteless.",2024-10-12,October,2024,6.0

(i’m not sure is it connected to ba, but still, i want to mention this). the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this. i want to separately point out one employee - shanell (if i am not mistaken, who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5). she is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! carrying on, i went to ba check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. however, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. i’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to cairo, the situation became even more complicated (i will spare the details). however, here again, brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. the nicest lady i’ve ever met, unfortunately, i didn’t catch her name, but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough. she also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  lastly, the nice lady (shame i don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position. he was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways i can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. to conclude, i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them. i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality, but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! for some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. however, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. as no one in",2020-12-25,December,2020,10.0

""build value guys"" and the profits will follow. its the oldest dictum in the book. i will give credit where credit is due. on the way back, on the ground, the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. very nice chap. we took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. fas in both directions were very good.",2019-03-07,March,2019,5.0

(i have flown both in 1st). the food is also business class quality. more casual dining rather than fine dining. taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche. one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. one tomato. one bit of green stuff. one straggly piece of prosciutto ham. total cost about 30p. outstanding! i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. totally, utterly boring. my wife had the soup which she said was nice. i then had jerk chicken dish. it was just about okay. the glassware and chinaware was okay. the cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in pizza express, except the stuff in pizza express is better. i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much ba could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. they trumpet the ""superb"" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug. £20 a bottle more! the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class. the world's most hated business class in the sky. i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. from a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.",2018-12-22,December,2018,6.0

1562,"""the CEO is running BA to the ground""","bangkok to london heathrow. despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe, on this route ba has a daylight flight (i can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. the fare was also pretty good. in the end, i have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. my issues were the following. i purchased a ticket in premium economy. the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the lhr-bkk-lhr route have been refitted. the seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and i had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. come on ! yes i got my amenities kit, a better pillow british papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. but the seat is old, not that comfy, the ife belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. i spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat. the seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great. the meal service was not good out of bkk. bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. no cheese nor crackers. not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the j/c had a brand new a la carte service as well.  cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. the only false note was the meal pre-selection. you get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. you have to wait for a very long time. by then my meal was cold and i sent it back. they did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. other than that it was this time a decent meal. having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. not acceptable on such a long haul. funny enough the bkk-lhr feature three meals so why not on the lhr-bkk leg ?. ba could be so much better. they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .",2017-11-21,November,2017,5.0

1620,"""depths to which BA have descended""","gatwick to orlando return. worst ever long-haul business class flight.  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). we have never liked ba’s business class (club world) seats since they changed over to the yin-yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. the seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul business class flight we have experienced. to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) in order to get out of the centre seats (rows e and f) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. the return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap. the service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. the entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age. this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. it will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. we will probably never fly ba long-haul business class (club world) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!",2017-10-17,October,2017,3.0

(used to be only ex london). fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. an ok chicken curry was served but i still don't see it as biz class food. a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. that is where the improvements ended. the morning offering of a cereal bar and t&cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience. the crew on this flight were great. young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! the return flight was less good. drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (crew member's first flight since qualifying) it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray. the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and t&c. customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate. service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! the 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp, the ife screens are tiny. mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. however, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. what these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of long haul crew - i hope they relax into the role soon! at least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut i admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened. however, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us / canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world - it really depends on what ba do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - i'm off).",2017-06-19,June,2017,7.0

(hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m&s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. the process i call 'ryanisation' of british airways is almost complete. you now charge for checked baggage (yes, i know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even ba used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? too costly, perhaps? i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""british airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",2017-04-07,April,2017,1.0
1925,"""can no longer live on past reputation""","having only flown easyjet / ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, i was pleased to see a relatively low-cost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome. in hindsight, i wish i'd booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation. to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. i expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m&s supplied food. i am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. no sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. i asked what they did have. their response 'bottle of water or a kit kat'. after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'they never give us enough food. it's mad. they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation. they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. i'd say i'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, i won't bother. what a shame.",2017-04-06,April,2017,1.0
1926,"""BA is now a no-frills carrier""","london heathrow to munich return. it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba. sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore. the loss of the free bar/food service on european flights is a real step down. even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for m&s food on board. oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now i have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. not even a free tea or bottle of water? (i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). the 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance. not wishing to pay this, by the time i checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from. i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with easyjet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with ba). check-in at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. so i couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. there was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't ba's fault and didn't have a hige impact. flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. on the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. could we? no, the earlier flight was full. rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on lufthansa instead. in summary, if flying ba on european routes these days, be aware that ba is now a no-frills carrier. lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",2017-04-06,April,2017,5.0

""try in heathrow"". i eventually phoned and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass. similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my bags in mumbai before getting on the lhr flight. when i got to the gate, the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. the fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. essentially despite ba being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. the flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. on the way back - forget it. firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! when i asked them to shift that, i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane. i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. done with bad grace. they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (i skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. the breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals i have ever had. the seats are tight - i endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. i'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and i'm not fat. i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! lufthansa, ethihad, emirates, singapore, eva, thai, cathay pacific - all do much better than this - even delta and american airlines internationals are much better. generally, the ba experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. i'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. its not because they are so much cheaper than others. finally, i'm now sitting in one of the ba lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago? (the last time i flew ba). overall - it's sad.",2017-02-28,February,2017,4.0

1988,"""rebrand to a budget airline""","lisbon to london heathrow. now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. over the last few years, leg room across european flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. that said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any european short-haul flight. the staff are friendly and polite. however, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. this does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. business class (which i sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. however, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me. otherwise, i get little in the way of added value. the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within europe. it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most european - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to ba these days. i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. my sympathies go to the staff, because i fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",2017-02-24,February,2017,2.0
1989,"""stay where British Airways used to be""","berlin tegel to london heathrow. i decided to give british airways a chance for a short weekend trip to london, because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low-cost airlines. and what do you know? i had a part of the low-cost experience paying a bigger price: no checked-in luggage included (not even as a oneworld emerald) and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages. a plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. the prices were even below airport ones. the bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could get your order - well, you can't compete with ryanair trying to do better the things they do best. i really miss the days when british airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and i would be happy to get back to those days. some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule, boarding was very efficient, which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous, a lot of space, very comfortable leather seats. as an advice, please don't try to be someone else, stay where british airways used to be and the success will come. losing an identity can cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free.",2017-02-23,February,2017,7.0
